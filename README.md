# Human-History-API-Integration
A simple API integrated web about Human History.

I used http://www.vizgr.org/historical-events 's API to show human history in a simple and somewhat interesting way.
The API fetches all its information from Wikipedia.

The API is a bit outdated so it only goes up to 2012.

You can check it out on rawgit https://cdn.rawgit.com/ArturoRodriguezRomero/Human-History-API-Integration/135899f7/index.html
